Things that need to be done for this package:

http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup/Odom

implement ugv velocity controller:
    Subscribes to topic "cmd_vel" to obtain target velocities.
    Applies INVERSE kinematics to convert robot velocity into velocities
        for each motor.
    Interfaces with Jaguar motor controllers to set target velocity for each motor.

implement ugv odometry publisher:
    Publishes robot velocity to odom topic.
    Interfaces with motor controllers to obtain actual velocity of each motor.
    Applies FORWARD kinematics to convert motor velocities into velocity of robot.
